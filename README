= SSHKey Puppet module

Note: "sshkey" is a bad name choice.  Puppet function of same name exists. Chage to something like "sshuserkey" at some point. 

Install a user's public key on a server.

Install a user's private key on server. (Take care with security).

== Example:

  sshkey::publickey { "aegir public key":
    user => $aegir_unix_user,
    group => $aegir_unix_group,
    sshdir => '/var/aegir/.ssh',
    content => "${aegir_key_type} ${aegir_pub_key} ${aegir_key_name}",
  }
